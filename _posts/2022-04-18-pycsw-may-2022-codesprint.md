## pycsw May 2022 code sprint

pycsw will hold a virtual sprint on 23 - 25 May 2022.  The purpose of the sprint
will be to focus on features for the 3.0 release (OGC API - Records support, JSON backend
support, custom transformations, etc.).

More information on the sprint can be found on the [pycsw wiki](https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/wiki/Code-Sprint-2022-05).

Looking forward to seeing you there!
